Description: MsImpute is a package for imputation of peptide intensity in proteomics experiments.
    It additionally contains tools for MAR/MNAR diagnosis and assessment of distortions to the probability 
    distribution of the data post imputation.  Currently, msImpute completes missing values by low-rank approximation of the underlying 
    data matrix.
