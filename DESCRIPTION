Description: MsImpute is a package for imputation of peptide intensity in proteomics experiments.
    It additionally contains tools for MAR/MNAR diagnosis and assessment of distortions to the probability 
    distribution of the data post imputation.  The missing values are imputed by low-rank approximation of
    the underlying data matrix if they are MAR (method = "v2"), by Barycenter approach if missingness is 
    MNAR ("v2-mnar"), or by Peptide Identity Propagation (PIP).
